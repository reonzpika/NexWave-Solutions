# Project Management AI SaaS

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Build a SaaS product management AI tool based on our current project management system. Start with personal use, refine and polish, then commercialize.

**Current Stage**: Ideation - Planning and validation phase

**Strategy**: 
- Phase 1: Use internally for personal project management
- Phase 2: Polish, refine, gather feedback
- Phase 3: Commercialize and launch to market

## Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Build a production-ready SaaS version of our project management AI system
- **Secondary Goal**: Use it personally first to validate and refine
- **Long-term Goal**: Commercialize and bring to market

## Current Understanding

### Product Concept
- **Core Value**: AI-powered project management that understands intent, proactively guides, and adapts to project needs
- **Differentiator**: Brutally honest AI advisor + adaptive project structures + template-driven guidance
- **Personal Use First**: You'll use this system yourself to validate and refine before commercialization

### Key Questions to Answer

**Product & Market**:
- What specific problem does this solve for users?
- Who is the target market? (Indie founders, small teams, enterprises?)
- What makes this different from existing project management tools?
- What's the core value proposition?

**Technical**:
- What technology stack? (Next.js, React, TypeScript?)
- AI/LLM integration approach?
- Backend architecture?
- Database choices?
- Authentication & authorization?
- Hosting & infrastructure?

**Business Model**:
- Pricing model? (Freemium, subscription tiers?)
- Revenue streams?
- Go-to-market strategy?

**MVP Scope**:
- What features are essential for MVP?
- What can wait for v2?
- What's the minimum viable product?

## Project Structure

This project structure adapts to SaaS project needs, combining elements from Idea Validation, Business Planning, and Product Development templates.

### Folder Structure Rationale
- **01-idea-validation/**: Market research, competitor analysis, customer discovery
- **02-business-planning/**: Business model, pricing, revenue streams, financial projections
- **03-product-development/**: Roadmap, tech stack, architecture, features, MVP planning
- **04-technical/**: Architecture, API specs, infrastructure, deployment
- **05-marketing/**: Go-to-market strategy, positioning, customer acquisition (for future commercialization)

This structure supports the "personal use first, then commercialize" strategy.

## Next Steps

1. **Idea Validation**: Validate market need and product-market fit
2. **Business Planning**: Define business model and revenue streams  
3. **Technology Research**: Research and decide on tech stack
4. **Architecture Design**: Design technical architecture
5. **MVP Planning**: Define MVP scope and features
6. **Development**: Build MVP for personal use
