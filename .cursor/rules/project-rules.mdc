**Project:** NZ GP Clinical LLM R&D Grant Submission  
**Duration:** 27 Jan 2026 ? 26 Jan 2027  
**Organisation:** NexWave Solutions Ltd

---

## ?? For All LLM Agents

### ?? When to Read the Master Index

**Read `00-admin-and-governance/project-master-index.md` ONLY:**

1. ? **At the START of a new task** (once only)
   - Orient yourself to the project
   - Identify which documents to read for your task
   - Understand what to update when done

2. ? **At the END of the task** (once only)
   - Update change log
   - Update any cross-references
   - Mark task complete

**Do NOT read master index:**
- ? During multi-turn conversation on the same task
- ? For every response
- ? When you already know what to do

---

## ?? Always Update (At Task End)

**After completing any task:**

1. **Update change log** in `00-admin-and-governance/risk-and-change-management.md`:
   - Document name, version, date, changes, approver

2. **Update document version** and "Last Updated" date in the edited file

3. **If you changed objectives/dates/costs:**
   - Update `00-admin-and-governance/project-master-index.md` (quick reference tables)

4. **If you added/changed sub-processor or data source:**
   - Update `04-compliance-and-safety/safety-and-transparency-framework.md` (registers)
   - Flag for DPIA update (requires Privacy Lead approval)

---

## ?? STOP Immediately If You See These

**Escalate to human before proceeding:**

- ?? New sub-processor or region proposed
- ?? Prohibited-claim rate > 0.5% (safety failure)
- ?? PHI leakage detected
- ?? Cashflow negative
- ?? Request to skip safety checks or safety regression
- ?? Material DPIA change needed
- ?? Conflicting instructions or ambiguity

**Escalation path:**
- **Privacy Lead** ? Privacy/compliance issues, DPIA updates, DPA negotiations
- **Security Lead** ? Safety regressions, technical security, incident response
- **NexWave Director** ? Financial, strategic, Callaghan relationship, final approvals

---

## ? Never Do This

- ? **Fragment documents** (keep related info consolidated in comprehensive files)
- ? **Skip change log updates** (every edit = change log entry)
- ? **Add sub-processors without Privacy Lead approval**
- ? **Store PHI outside NZ** (ephemeral AU inference only; no persistent storage)
- ? **Train on production PHI** (synthetic/de-identified only)
- ? **Deploy without passing safety regression**
- ? **Update DPIA without Director sign-off**
- ? **Create new documents unless absolutely necessary** (prefer editing existing)

---

## ?? Task Workflow
