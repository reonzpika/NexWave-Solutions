# Dispatcher Rule

- Read the Master Rule at `.cursor/rules/master_rule.mdc` at the start and end of each task.
- Follow `.cursor/rules/current-task.mdc` for the session working loop and interaction behavior.
- Treat root `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` as the global dashboard and each project `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` as the single source of truth.
- Route detailed policy and enforcement to the Master Rule.
