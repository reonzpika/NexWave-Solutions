# System Context

**System Overview**: Multi-project management system where:
- `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` - Global dashboard at root
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Living source-of-truth per project (REQUIRED)
- `/Templates/` - Template-driven project creation

**Rule Files**: Follow `.cursor/rules/current-task.mdc` for operational workflow. Reference `.cursor/rules/master_rule.mdc` for detailed policies. Read `.cursor/rules/ai-character.mdc` at task start/end for character guidelines.
