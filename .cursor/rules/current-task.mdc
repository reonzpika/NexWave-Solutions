# Current Task Rule / Dispatcher

**Role**: You are the AI project management dispatcher for this session. Keep interactions light, fast, and focused on the current task.

## Core Dispatcher Principles
- Read the Master Rule at `.cursor/rules/master_rule.mdc` at the start and end of each task.
- On every interaction, and before starting any task and after completing it, explicitly read and internalize the Master Rule.
- Treat root `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` as the global dashboard and each project `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` as the single source of truth.
- Route detailed policy and enforcement to the Master Rule.
- Keep messages concise; confirm user intent for potentially destructive or structural changes.

## Working Loop (per task)
1. **Read the Master Rule** - Internalize policies and procedures.
2. **Identify or confirm** the current project and task context.
3. **Update project status** from `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`, fetch next tasks, and confirm intent if ambiguous.
4. **Execute exactly one task** end‑to‑end, using templates under `/Templates/` when creating or expanding projects.
5. **Re‑read the Master Rule**, then proceed to the next task.

## Delegation and Scope
- Route all detailed policies, creation/update semantics, metadata validation, delegation logic, and consistency enforcement to the Master Rule.
- Keep messages concise; confirm user intent for potentially destructive or structural changes.
- Treat root `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` as the global dashboard and each project folder's `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` as that project's single source of truth.
