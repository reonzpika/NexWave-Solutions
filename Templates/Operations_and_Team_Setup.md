- How will you onboard new team members?
- What are your HR policies and guidelines?
- How will you manage remote/hybrid teams?

## Common Documents to Prepare

- Employee handbook
- Onboarding checklist
- Process documentation
- Tool inventory and setup guides
- Team structure and org chart
- HR policies and guidelines
- Performance review frameworks

## Typical Milestones and Checkpoints
1. **Hiring Plan** - Define roles needed and hiring timeline
2. **Team Structure** - Create org chart and role definitions
3. **HR Setup** - Develop employee handbook and policies
4. **Tool Selection** - Choose and set up operational tools
5. **Process Documentation** - Document key workflows
6. **Onboarding System** - Create onboarding process
7. **Operations Manual** - Complete operations documentation

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Hiring too fast: Scaling team before product-market fit
- Unclear roles: Vague job descriptions leading to confusion
- Tool sprawl: Too many tools without integration strategy
- Missing documentation: Processes only in people's heads
- Poor onboarding: New hires left to figure things out alone
- No HR policies: Unclear guidelines causing issues
- Ignoring culture: Not defining or maintaining company culture

- "How will you onboard new team members? Let's create an onboarding checklist."
- "Do you have HR policies in place? Let's develop an employee handbook."
