## Typical Milestones and Checkpoints
1. **Funding Strategy** - Define funding amount, use of funds, and investor type
2. **Pitch Deck** - Create compelling pitch presentation
3. **Investor List** - Identify and research target investors
4. **Legal Structure** - Set up cap table and equity allocation
5. **Outreach** - Begin investor introductions and meetings
6. **Due Diligence** - Prepare materials for investor review
7. **Term Negotiation** - Negotiate and close funding round

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Unclear use of funds: Vague description of how you'll spend the money
- Poor pitch narrative: Confusing or unconvincing story
- Wrong investor fit: Targeting investors who don't invest in your stage/sector
- Unrealistic valuation: Valuation that doesn't match market conditions
- Incomplete materials: Missing key documents for due diligence
- No warm introductions: Cold outreach without warm intros
- Ignoring term sheets: Not understanding deal terms

## Example Prompts for AI to Reference During Setup Conversations
- "How much funding do you need and what will you use it for?"
- "Let's create your pitch deck structure. What's your core narrative?"
- "Who are your target investors? Let's build an investor target list."
- "What's your equity allocation plan? Let's set up your cap table."
- "Have you prepared due diligence materials? Let's create a data room checklist."
- "What's your valuation expectation and how did you arrive at it?"
