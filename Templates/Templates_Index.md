## Template Loading Triggers

AI should load a template when:
- New project folder detected with sparse metadata
- User requests project setup assistance
- AI detects gaps or missing standard folders/files in existing project
- User's project description matches template keywords or stage

**Loading Strategy**: Load only the selected template file, not all templates, to keep context focused.
