# Product Development Planning Template

## Purpose of This Stage/Scenario
Plan and execute product development from MVP to launch. This stage covers feature prioritization, technology decisions, development workflows, and team coordination.

## Key Questions for Founders
- What features are essential for your MVP?
- What technology stack best fits your needs and team?
- How will you organize development work (sprints, milestones)?
- What are your technical constraints and requirements?
- Who is on your development team and what are their roles?
- How will you test and validate features?
- What's your launch strategy?

## Common Documents to Prepare
- Product roadmap
- Feature backlog and prioritization
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical architecture documentation
- Technology stack decisions
- Sprint plans and milestones
- Testing strategy
- Launch checklist

## Typical Milestones and Checkpoints
1. **Roadmap Definition** - Create product roadmap with priorities
2. **Technology Stack** - Select and document tech stack decisions
3. **Architecture Design** - Design technical architecture
4. **Sprint Planning** - Set up development sprints and milestones
5. **Feature Development** - Build features according to roadmap
6. **Testing & QA** - Complete testing before launch
7. **Launch** - Execute launch plan and go live

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Feature creep: Adding too many features to MVP
- Technology over-engineering: Choosing complex tech when simple works
- Poor prioritization: Building features users don't need
- Inadequate testing: Skipping QA before launch
- Unclear requirements: Vague user stories leading to rework
- Ignoring technical debt: Accumulating code quality issues
- No launch plan: Unprepared for go-live

## Example Prompts for AI to Reference During Setup Conversations
- "Let's define your MVP scope. What features are absolutely essential?"
- "What technology stack are you considering? Let's document the pros and cons."
- "Let's create your product roadmap with prioritized features."
- "How will you organize development work? Let's set up sprint planning."
- "Let's write user stories for your key features with clear acceptance criteria."
- "What's your testing strategy before launch?"
