# Idea Validation and Market Research Template

## Purpose of This Stage/Scenario
Validate that your business idea solves a real problem for a specific target market. This stage focuses on understanding customer needs, market opportunities, and competitive landscape before committing significant resources to development.

## Key Questions for Founders
- What specific problem are you solving?
- Who experiences this problem most acutely?
- How are people currently solving this problem (or failing to solve it)?
- What evidence do you have that people would pay for your solution?
- Who are your direct and indirect competitors?
- What makes your solution different or better?
- What assumptions need to be validated before building?

## Common Documents to Prepare
- Customer interview notes and synthesis
- Problem statement document
- Market research summary
- Competitive analysis matrix
- Customer persona profiles
- Value proposition canvas
- Assumption validation checklist
- MVP scope definition

## Typical Milestones and Checkpoints
1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly articulate the problem space
2. **Customer Discovery** - Complete 10+ customer interviews
3. **Market Analysis** - Research market size and competition
4. **Assumption Validation** - Test key assumptions with evidence
5. **MVP Decision** - Define minimum viable product scope
6. **Go/No-Go Decision** - Decide whether to proceed to build phase

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Confirmation bias: Only seeking feedback that validates your idea
- Solution-first thinking: Building before understanding the problem deeply
- Insufficient customer research: Talking to fewer than 10 potential customers
- Ignoring indirect competitors: Only analyzing direct competitors
- Scope creep: Making MVP too complex
- Analysis paralysis: Researching indefinitely without making decisions

## Example Prompts for AI to Reference During Setup Conversations
- "Let's start by defining the core problem you're solving. Who experiences this problem?"
- "What assumptions about your customers or market need validation?"
- "Have you spoken to potential customers yet? Let's set up a customer interview structure."
- "Let's map out your competitive landscape - who else is solving this problem?"
- "Based on your research, what's the minimum feature set needed to test your core value proposition?"
