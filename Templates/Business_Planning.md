# Business Planning & Modeling Template

## Purpose of This Stage/Scenario
Develop a clear business model, understand your revenue streams, cost structure, and financial needs. This stage helps you create a sustainable business foundation and prepare for growth decisions.

## Key Questions for Founders
- What is your business model? (SaaS, marketplace, freemium, etc.)
- How will you generate revenue?
- What are your key cost drivers?
- What are your unit economics (CAC, LTV, gross margin)?
- How much funding do you need and what will it be used for?
- What are your key assumptions for financial projections?
- What are your key metrics and KPIs?

## Common Documents to Prepare
- Business Model Canvas
- Revenue model breakdown
- Cost structure analysis
- Financial projections (12-24 months)
- Unit economics worksheet
- Funding needs assessment
- Key metrics dashboard
- Pricing strategy document

## Typical Milestones and Checkpoints
1. **Business Model Definition** - Complete Business Model Canvas
2. **Revenue Model** - Define and validate revenue streams
3. **Cost Analysis** - Map out cost structure and key drivers
4. **Financial Projections** - Create 12-24 month projections
5. **Unit Economics** - Calculate CAC, LTV, and margins
6. **Funding Plan** - Determine funding needs and use of funds
7. **Metrics Framework** - Define KPIs and tracking system

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overly optimistic projections: Unrealistic growth assumptions
- Ignoring unit economics: Not understanding if you can make money per customer
- Unclear revenue model: Vague or undefined monetization strategy
- Missing cost drivers: Underestimating operational costs
- No scenario planning: Only planning for best-case scenario
- Metrics overload: Tracking too many metrics without focus

## Example Prompts for AI to Reference During Setup Conversations
- "Let's map out your business model using the Business Model Canvas framework."
- "How do you plan to make money? Let's break down your revenue streams."
- "What are your key costs? Let's build your cost structure."
- "Have you calculated your unit economics? Let's determine CAC and LTV."
- "How much funding do you need and what will you use it for?"
- "What are the 3-5 key metrics that matter most for your business?"
