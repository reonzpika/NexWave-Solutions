- **R&D Information Management** (MLflow, DVC, safety dashboard, transparency SOP)
- **Project Management set-up** (stage-gates, risk/change logs, release checklist)

**Strategy:** Keep cash minimal; use recognised certificate courses; claim one-off set-ups as internal labour.

## Risks and Mitigations (CapDev-Specific)

### Risk: Free Courses Questioned by Reviewers

**Mitigation:**
- OPC and Ko Awatea are NZ-recognised government/health sector providers
- Include all certificates with dates
- Emphasise DPIA/HISO artefacts for credibility
- $2,880 of internal labour demonstrates substantive capability building

### Risk: CapDev < 5% of Grant Due to Changes

**Requirement:** CapDev ? 5% of grant ? $2,145

**Mitigation:**
- Keep 30 hours CapDev labour ($2,880)
- Adjust up slightly before first claim if needed
- Current allocation: $2,880 / $42,893 = 6.7% ?

### Risk: Transparency Not Updated

**Mitigation:**
- Add monthly reminder to project calendar
- Include update log on transparency page
- Add transparency check to release checklist
- Track in change log
