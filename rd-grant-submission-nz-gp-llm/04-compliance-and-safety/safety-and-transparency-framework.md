# 1. NAIAEAG Alignment Note

## Background

Te Whatu Ora's **National AI and Emerging Technology Expert Advisory Group (NAIAEAG)** has issued precautionary guidance on the use of AI in health:

- **No PHI into unapproved LLMs** (especially third-party commercial models)
- **Transparency** about data sources, model behaviour, and limitations
- **Human oversight** (assist-only; clinician-in-the-loop)
- **Safety and accountability** (measurable safety metrics; incident response)

---

## ClinicPro Alignment

### 1. No PHI into Unapproved LLMs

**ClinicPro approach:**
- **No training on production PHI:** Model development uses synthetic and de-identified data only. No patient data is used for training.
- **Approved use only:** ClinicPro is deployed under explicit clinic agreement with signed DPAs. All data flows are documented in DPIA.
- **No third-party LLM APIs:** ClinicPro uses a self-hosted, NZ-controlled model. No patient data is sent to third-party commercial LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).

**Evidence:**
- Synthetic/De-identification SOP (Section 7 below)
- DPIA (Section: Training Data Separation)
- DPA clauses (no secondary uses without consent)

---

### 2. Transparency

**ClinicPro approach:**
- **Data sources:** Public transparency page lists all training data sources (NZ public clinical sources, synthetic corpora). See Section 4 below.
- **Model versions:** Transparency page includes model version, last updated, change log.
- **Regions and sub-processors:** Transparency page lists AU compute region, NZ storage provider, and any ASR provider. Updated when changes occur.
- **Limitations:** Transparency page and clinician notices clearly state: "Assist-only; no diagnostic or treatment advice; use clinical judgement."

**Evidence:**
- Transparency page draft (Section 4 below)
- Transparency SOP (Section 5 below)
- Clinician/patient notices (see `privacy-compliance-quick-reference.md`)

---

### 3. Human Oversight (Assist-Only, Clinician-in-the-Loop)

**ClinicPro approach:**
- **Assist-only policy:**
  - No diagnostic directives (e.g., "diagnose diabetes")
  - No treatment directives (e.g., "prescribe metformin")
  - Refuse unsafe requests with safe next steps (e.g., "I cannot diagnose; please consult clinical guidelines")
- **Clinician review required:**
  - All scribe outputs must be reviewed and edited before saving to patient record
  - No automatic note insertion into Medtech
  - Inbox suggestions are advisory only; clinician makes final triage decision
- **Labelling and warnings:**
  - All outputs labelled: "AI-generated; use with clinical judgement"
  - Periodic UI reminders: "Review for accuracy"

**Evidence:**
- Policy engine and refusal scaffolds (O3 deliverable)
- Safety regression packs (Section 2 below)
- Clinician training materials (pre-pilot)

---

### 4. Safety and Accountability

**ClinicPro approach:**
- **Measurable safety metrics:**
  - Prohibited-claim rate ? 0.5% (monthly testing)
  - Refusal appropriateness ? 95% (monthly testing)
  - Zero PHI leakage in red-team tests
- **Monthly safety regressions:** Systematic testing of safety classifiers, refusal behaviour, and prohibited claims. See Section 2 below.
- **Incident response:** Breach notification within 24 hours; containment, recovery, and post-incident review. See Section 3 below.
- **Audit trails:** Operational logs (no PHI) retained for 90 days; admin actions audited.

**Evidence:**
- Safety regression packs (monthly)
- Safety dashboard (tracks metrics over time)
- Incident runbook (Section 3 below)
- Audit logs (SIEM)

---

## NAIAEAG Compliance Status

? **Aligned with NAIAEAG precautionary guidance:**
- No PHI used for training; no third-party LLM APIs
- Transparency page published; data sources and limitations disclosed
- Assist-only with human oversight; no auto-insert
- Measurable safety metrics; incident response procedures

---

---

# 2. Safety Regression Pack Template

## Purpose

**Monthly safety regressions** ensure ClinicPro maintains safe, assist-only behaviour over time.

# 3. Incident Runbook

## Purpose

**Incident runbook** defines roles, timelines, and steps for breach notification and response.

---

## Incident Types

1. **PHI breach:** Unauthorised access, disclosure, or loss of PHI
2. **Security breach:** Unauthorised access to systems (no PHI confirmed)
3. **Safety failure:** Model produces prohibited claims in production (detected)
4. **Sub-processor breach:** AU cloud/NZ storage/ASR provider notifies breach

---

## Incident Response Phases

### Phase 1: Detect (Immediate)

**Triggers:**
- SIEM alert (unusual access, data egress, failed auth)
- User report (clinician, patient, clinic staff)
- Sub-processor notification (breach notice from AU cloud/NZ storage)
- Safety dashboard alert (prohibited-claim rate spike)

**Actions:**
- **On-call escalation:** Alert Security Lead (24/7 contact)
- **Initial assessment:** Confirm incident type and severity (PHI involved? How many records? Root cause?)
- **Log incident:** Record in incident log (date/time, type, initial assessment)

---

### Phase 2: Contain (Within 1 Hour)

**Actions:**
- **Revoke keys:** If PHI exposure suspected, revoke NZ-held encryption keys (immediate lockout of AU inference)
- **Isolate AU inference:** Disable cross-border requests (fall back to NZ-only if possible)
- **Disable features:** Disable affected features in Medtech (e.g., scribe, inbox)
- **Engage sub-processor SOC:** If sub-processor breach, engage their Security Operations Center for containment

**Decision point:** Is PHI confirmed exposed?
- **Yes:** Proceed to Phase 3 (Notify)
- **No:** Continue investigation; contain spread; monitor

---

### Phase 3: Notify (Within 24 Hours)

#### Notify Controller (Clinic)

**Timeline:** Immediate notification; detailed notice within 24 hours of confirmed PHI breach

**Content:**
- Nature of breach (PHI types affected; number of records)
- When breach occurred and when detected
- Likely consequences (risk to patients)
- Measures taken and proposed (containment, remediation)
- Contact point for questions (Privacy Lead)

**Method:** Email + phone call to Clinic Privacy Officer and Clinic Director

---

#### Notify OPC (If Required)

**Threshold:** Breach is likely to cause serious harm to individuals

**Timeline:** Without undue delay; cooperate with Controller on OPC notification

**Content:**
- Description of breach
- PHI categories and number of individuals affected
- Likely consequences
- Measures taken
- Contact details

**Method:** OPC online breach notification form + follow-up as requested

---

#### Notify Affected Individuals (If Required)

**Threshold:** Serious harm likely; OPC advises notification

**Timeline:** As soon as practicable

**Content:**
- Description of breach in plain language
- PHI types affected
- Steps individuals can take (e.g., monitor accounts, contact clinic)
- Contact point for questions

**Method:** Via clinic (Controller notifies patients)

---

### Phase 4: Investigate and Remediate (Within 7 Days)

**Actions:**
- **Root cause analysis:** Determine how breach occurred (technical failure, misconfiguration, human error, external attack)
- **Remediation plan:** Fix root cause (patch vulnerability, update access controls, revoke compromised credentials, update DPA clauses)
- **Evidence preservation:** Retain logs, system snapshots, and forensic evidence for OPC or legal review
- **Sub-processor follow-up:** If sub-processor breach, obtain incident report and remediation plan; exercise audit rights

---

### Phase 5: Recover (Within 30 Days)

**Actions:**
- **Restore services:** Re-enable features once remediation complete and tested
- **Key rotation:** Rotate all encryption keys (even if not compromised)
- **Access review:** Recertify all user access (quarterly review brought forward)
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced SIEM monitoring for 90 days post-incident

---

### Phase 6: Learn (Within 60 Days)

**Actions:**
- **Post-incident review:** Convene Privacy Lead, Security Lead, NexWave Director
- **Document lessons learned:** What went well; what could improve; control updates needed
- **Update controls:** Implement preventive measures (new firewall rules, new alerts, updated procedures)
- **Update DPIA:** If material change to risks or controls, update DPIA
- **Transparency page:** If public-facing breach, add summary to transparency page change log (no sensitive details)

# 4. Transparency Page Draft

## ClinicPro Transparency Page (Public-Facing)

**URL:** [https://clinicpro.nz/transparency](https://clinicpro.nz/transparency) (example)

---

### Purpose

This page explains how ClinicPro handles patient information, what data sources we use, where processing occurs, and who our sub-processors are.

---

### What ClinicPro Does

ClinicPro is an AI assistant for New Zealand general practitioners. It helps with:

- **Scribing:** Drafts clinical notes from consultations (SOAP format)
- **Inbox management:** Classifies, summarises, and suggests actions for inbox items (labs, letters, referrals)
- **History summaries:** Provides concise patient context for clinician review

**Important:** ClinicPro is **assist-only**. It does not diagnose, prescribe, or make clinical decisions. All outputs must be reviewed by a clinician using their clinical judgement.

---

### Data Sources (Training Data)

ClinicPro is trained on:

1. **NZ public clinical sources** (as permitted by copyright and data use agreements):
   - [Example: BPAC NZ clinical resources (with permission)]
   - [Example: Pharmac medication database (public)]
   - [Example: NZ Formulary excerpts (with permission)]
2. **Synthetic data** (artificially generated clinical scenarios; no real patients)
3. **De-identified data** (real clinical data with all identifiers removed; used only where synthetic data insufficient)

**What we do NOT use:**
- ? Production patient data (no training on live patient records)
- ? Third-party commercial LLM APIs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)

**Source register:** See Section 6 below for detailed list.

---

### Where Processing Occurs

**New Zealand:**
- All patient records are stored in New Zealand only.
- Encryption keys are held in New Zealand (KMS/HSM).

**Australia (transient only):**
- AI inference may occur on secure servers in Australia for fast response times.
- **No patient information is stored in Australia.** Processing is ephemeral (typically < 60 seconds).
- Data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256) with NZ-held keys.

**Compliance:**
- Cross-border processing complies with Privacy Act 2020 IPP 12 (cross-border disclosure).
- We have completed a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and signed Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with all sub-processors.

---

### Sub-Processors

| Sub-Processor | Service | Region | Purpose | DPA Status |
|---------------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| [AU Cloud Provider] | Cloud compute | Australia (Sydney) | AI inference (transient only) | ? Signed |
| [NZ Storage Provider] | Cloud storage | New Zealand (Auckland) | PHI storage (encrypted, NZ keys) | ? Signed |
| [ASR Provider] | Speech recognition | [Region] | Audio-to-text (if used) | ? Signed |

**Sub-processor register:** See Section 6 below for full details.

# 7. Synthetic and De-Identification SOPs

## A. Synthetic Data Generation SOP

### Purpose
Generate synthetic clinical data for model training and testing (no real patients).

### Synthetic Data Types
1. **GP consultations** (audio transcripts, clinical notes)
2. **Inbox items** (lab results, referral letters, radiology reports, patient messages)
3. **Patient histories** (demographics, conditions, medications, allergies)

### Generation Process
1. **Define scenarios:** Create realistic clinical scenarios (e.g., diabetes review, chest infection, mental health check-in)
2. **Use templates:** Base on anonymized templates or fictional personas (no real patient data)
3. **Variability:** Introduce variability (ages, conditions, medications, language) to avoid overfitting
4. **Review:** Clinical advisor reviews synthetic data for realism and safety (no prohibited patterns)
5. **Tag and version:** Store in DVC with tags (e.g., `synthetic-gp-consults-v1`)

### Quality Checks
- [ ] No real patient identifiers (NHI, names, addresses)
- [ ] Clinically plausible (advisor sign-off)
- [ ] Diverse (age, gender, ethnicity, conditions)
- [ ] No prohibited patterns (e.g., synthetic diagnostic directives)

---

## B. De-Identification SOP

### Purpose
De-identify real clinical data for model training when synthetic data is insufficient.

### De-Identification Principles (Privacy Act 2020, HIPC 2020)
1. **Remove direct identifiers:**
   - NHI, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
   - Dates (replace with relative dates or age ranges)
   - Unique identifiers (e.g., rare conditions, specific locations)
2. **Generalize quasi-identifiers:**
   - Age: use ranges (e.g., "50-59" instead of "54")
   - Location: use regions (e.g., "Auckland" instead of specific suburb)
3. **Suppress small cells:** If data point is unique or rare, suppress or aggregate
4. **Test re-identification risk:** Attempt to re-identify individuals from de-identified data; if possible, increase de-identification

### De-Identification Process
1. **Source data:** Obtain real clinical data under ethics approval and clinic consent
2. **Automated de-identification:** Use NLP tools to detect and remove/mask identifiers
3. **Manual review:** Clinical advisor reviews de-identified data for remaining identifiers
4. **Re-identification test:** Attempt to match de-identified data to source data; assess risk
5. **Sign-off:** Privacy Lead and clinical advisor sign off on de-identified dataset
6. **Tag and version:** Store in DVC with tags (e.g., `deidentified-inbox-v1`)

### Risk Assessment (Quarterly)
- [ ] Review de-identification methods for adequacy
- [ ] Test sample of de-identified data for re-identification risk
- [ ] Update de-identification tools/methods if needed
- [ ] Document assessment in risk register
