# 1. IPP 12 Cross-Border Control Checklist
## Option B: AU Inference; No Persistent PHI Outside NZ

### Lawful Basis and Scope
- [ ] **Identify personal/health information categories** disclosed cross-border:
  - Audio/transcript segments for scribing (transient)
  - Inbox content (labs, letters, referrals, metadata)
  - Limited clinical context for history summaries
  - User prompts and assist-only outputs
- [ ] **Confirm disclosure is necessary** for the stated service:
  - Assist-only scribe, inbox triage, history summaries
  - Cannot be delivered with NZ-only infrastructure at target latency/cost
- [ ] **Minimal fields disclosed**:
  - Only data required for the specific task (least privilege)
  - No full patient records sent; scoped retrieval only

---

### Comparable Safeguards (Contractual)
- [ ] **Controller?Processor DPA** in place with clinic:
  - Purpose limitation (scribe, inbox, summaries only)
  - Security controls specified (encryption, access controls, audit)
  - Sub-processing and audit rights
  - Cross-border annex (regions, data types, no persistent PHI outside NZ)
  - Deletion on termination
- [ ] **Sub-processor DPA** with AU cloud provider:
  - Comparable safeguards to NZ law
  - Region lock (nominated AU regions only)
  - No persistent PHI outside NZ; ephemeral only
  - Onward-transfer limits (no further disclosure without consent)
  - Breach notification (24hr timeline; cooperation with OPC)
- [ ] **Audit rights** for Controller and OPC where required
- [ ] **Breach notification timelines** contractually agreed (24hr notification to clinic)

---

### Technical and Organisational Controls
- [ ] **Encryption in transit:** TLS 1.2+ for all cross-border transfers
- [ ] **Encryption at rest:** AES-256 for any temporary storage (NZ keys)
- [ ] **NZ-held keys (KMS/HSM):**
  - Encryption keys stored in NZ only
  - Key rotation schedule (e.g., 90 days)
  - Revocation capability (immediate lockout on breach)
- [ ] **Region lock:** Nominated AU regions only (hard ban on other regions; no auto-migrate)
- [ ] **No PHI in logs:** Operational logs exclude PHI; masking where needed
- [ ] **Access control:**
  - MFA required for admin access
  - Least privilege (role-based access)
  - Quarterly access recertification
- [ ] **Supplier due diligence:**
  - Security posture review (certifications, audit reports)
  - Right to audit sub-processors

---

### Data Minimisation and Transparency
- [ ] **Limit fields disclosed** to only what is required for the task:
  - Scribe: audio/transcript only (no full patient history)
  - Inbox: message content + minimal metadata (no excess clinical data)
  - History: scoped retrieval (date ranges, relevant conditions only)
- [ ] **Publish transparency page:**
  - Data sources used
  - Regions and sub-processors
  - Update log (last updated, change history)
- [ ] **Provide clinic notices:**
  - Purpose, cross-border inference, no persistent PHI outside NZ
  - No training on PHI
  - Access/correction routes; contact details
- [ ] **Provide patient consent/notice** for scribing:
  - Consent obtained before recording
  - Clear notice: "AI scribe may process on AU servers; not stored there; records remain in NZ"
  - Opt-out process documented

---

### Data Retention and Deletion
- [ ] **No persistent PHI outside NZ:**
  - AU inference uses ephemeral caches only (short TTL, e.g., < 60 seconds)
  - No storage, backup, or archival of PHI in AU
- [ ] **NZ storage only** for any at-rest PHI:
  - Encrypted with NZ-held keys
  - Defined retention period (e.g., ? 30 days if clinic requires storage)
  - Automatic deletion on expiry or on request
- [ ] **Secure deletion process** documented:
  - Cryptographic erasure (key deletion)
  - Certify deletion to Controller on request or termination

---

### Data Subject Rights Support
- [ ] **Processor assists Controller** with:
  - Access requests (provide PHI within SLA)
  - Correction requests (update records)
  - Objection/withdrawal (patient declines scribing; clinic disables features)
  - Deletion requests (secure deletion on request)
- [ ] **SLAs defined** for data subject rights responses (e.g., 10 business days)

---

### Ongoing Assurance
- [ ] **DPIA completed** and approved (v1.0 signed by NexWave Director)
- [ ] **Quarterly DPIA review:** Update on material change (new sub-processor, region, data use)
- [ ] **Change control** for new sub-processors/regions:
  - Privacy Lead approval required
  - Re-run DPIA if material change
  - Update transparency page
- [ ] **Continuous monitoring:**
  - SIEM alerts for unusual data flows (PHI egress to non-AU regions)
  - Audit logs reviewed monthly
- [ ] **Incident drills:** Test breach notification process annually
- [ ] **Annual supplier reassessment:** Security posture, compliance, audit rights exercised

# 4. Consent and Notice Text

## A. Clinician-Facing Notice (Clinic Agreement / Staff Handbook)

**Title:** ClinicPro AI Scribe and Inbox Management ? Privacy Notice for Clinicians

**Purpose:**  
ClinicPro uses an AI assistant to help you draft clinical notes (scribe), manage inbox items (triage), and summarize patient histories. This notice explains how patient information is handled.

**What ClinicPro does:**
- **Scribe:** Drafts SOAP notes from consultation audio/notes (you review and edit before saving)
- **Inbox:** Classifies, summarises, and suggests actions for inbox items (labs, letters, referrals)
- **History summaries:** Provides concise overviews of patient context for your review

**Assist-only:**  
ClinicPro never provides diagnostic or treatment advice. All outputs are assist-only and require your clinical judgement and review.

**Data handling:**
- **Where processed:** AI inference may occur on secure servers in Australia; patient information is not stored there. All patient records remain in New Zealand.
- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256) with NZ-held keys.
- **Training:** ClinicPro does not train its AI on your patients' data. Development uses synthetic and de-identified data only.

**Your responsibilities:**
- **Consent:** Obtain patient consent before using the AI scribe for consultations (see patient notice below).
- **Review:** Always review AI-generated outputs for accuracy and appropriateness before accepting.
- **Opt-out:** Patients may decline AI scribing; you can disable features for specific patients or consultations.

**Access and correction:**  
Patients may request access to or correction of their information via your clinic's usual processes. ClinicPro will assist as needed.

**Questions or concerns:**  
Contact [NexWave Privacy Lead email] or [Clinic Privacy Officer].

**Transparency:**  
For details on data sources, regions, and sub-processors, see: [ClinicPro Transparency Page URL]

## B. Patient Consent/Notice for Scribing (Consultation Room / Consent Form)

**Title:** AI Scribe Consent Notice

**What is the AI scribe?**  
With your consent, your clinician may use an AI assistant (ClinicPro) to help draft notes during your consultation. The AI listens to the conversation and suggests a draft for your clinician to review and edit.

**Important:**
- The AI **does not make medical decisions**. Your clinician reviews all AI-generated notes and uses their clinical judgement.
- Your consultation **may be processed on secure servers in Australia**, but the recording and notes **are not stored there**. Your medical records remain in New Zealand.
- The AI **does not train on your information**. Your consultation is used only to create your notes.

**Your choice:**
- You can **say no** to AI scribing at any time, and your care will not be affected.
- If you prefer, your clinician will take notes manually.

**Questions?**  
Ask your clinician or contact [Clinic Privacy Officer] at [email/phone].

**Consent:**  
? I consent to the use of AI scribing for this consultation.  
? I do not consent; please take notes manually.

**Compliance:**
- This cross-border processing complies with **Privacy Act 2020 IPP 12** (cross-border disclosure of personal information).
- We have completed a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** and obtained legal advice to ensure compliance.

**Your rights:**
- You have the right to access, correct, or delete your information via your clinic.
- You may object to cross-border processing (your clinic can disable ClinicPro for your records).

**Questions?**  
Contact [NexWave Privacy Lead] at [email] or [Clinic Privacy Officer].
