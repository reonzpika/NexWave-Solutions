## ?? For LLM Agents: Task-Based Guidance

**Note:** Read this section ONCE at task start. Do NOT re-read during multi-turn conversations.

### How to Use This Section

1. **Identify your task type** (A-F below)
2. **Note which files to read** for your task
3. **Note what to update** when task is complete
4. **Work on the task** (refer to domain docs as needed)
5. **Complete updates** (change log, cross-references)

---

### A. Compliance Tasks (DPIA, IPP 12, DPA, Consent Notices)

**Read these files:**
1. `04-compliance-and-safety/privacy-compliance-quick-reference.md` (IPP 12, HISO, DPA clauses, consent text)
2. **If material change** (new sub-processor/region): `04-compliance-and-safety/dpia-draft.md` (full DPIA)
3. **If transparency update needed**: `04-compliance-and-safety/safety-and-transparency-framework.md`

**Always update at task end:**
- Change log in `risk-and-change-management.md`
- Document version and "Last Updated" date
- If sub-processor/source changed: Update registers in `safety-and-transparency-framework.md`
- If material change: Flag for DPIA update (requires Privacy Lead + Director approval)

**Prohibitions:**
- ? No sub-processors without Privacy Lead approval
- ? No PHI storage outside NZ (ephemeral AU inference only)
