# Prompt: Create Test Scenarios for Rule System

**Objective**: Create comprehensive simulated user workflows and epic stories to validate that the rule system works consistently across different scenarios.

**Requirements**:
1. **Create diverse test scenarios** covering:
   - New project creation (various stages/types)
   - Project updates and status changes
   - Dashboard maintenance
   - Template selection and usage
   - Error conditions (missing files, unclear intent)
   - Cross-project dependencies

2. **Each scenario should include**:
   - User input (simulating real user requests - potentially poorly articulated)
   - Expected AI behavior based on rules
   - Files that should be created/modified
   - Character/style verification (honest, challenging, clarifying)
   - Verification points to check rule compliance

3. **Test areas**:
   - System context understanding
   - Character/communication style application
   - Template selection and folder creation
   - PROJECT_SUMMARY.md requirement enforcement
   - Dashboard updates
   - User intent understanding and clarification
   - Research when needed

4. **Format**: Epic stories with user stories format (As a... I want... So that...) followed by step-by-step workflow simulation

5. **Include edge cases**:
   - Ambiguous requests
   - Missing information
   - Conflicting data
   - Stage transitions
