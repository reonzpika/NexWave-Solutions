# Project Overview: NZ-Sovereign Clinical LLM for GP Workflow

**Project Name:** ClinicPro: NZ-Sovereign Clinical LLM (assist-only)  
**Organisation:** NexWave Solutions Ltd  
**Grant Type:** Callaghan Innovation - New to R&D Grant  
**Project Duration:** 27 Jan 2026 - 26 Jan 2027 (12 months)  
**Total Eligible Costs:** $107,232 (excl. GST)  
**Grant Request:** $42,893 (40%)  
**Co-Funding:** $64,339 (60% from GP clinical work income)

---

## Executive Summary

This project proposes building a New Zealand-sovereign clinical LLM to address critical workload and burnout issues facing NZ general practitioners. The AI system will assist GPs with four high-impact workflows:

1. **Inbox Management** - Triage, classify, and summarise hospital letters, lab results, referrals
2. **Clinical Coding** - Suggest NZ billing codes (ACC, PHO, Care Plus eligibility)
3. **Referral Quality Checking** - Flag missing HealthPathways criteria before sending referrals
4. **Care Gap Monitoring** - Alert overdue NZ-guideline chronic disease monitoring

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✓ NZ data sovereignty (self-hosted in NZ/AU, NZ-held keys)
- ✓ Cost-effective at scale (20-50x cheaper than Azure OpenAI: $5-10k/month vs $140-170k/month)
- ✓ NZ-tuned (Pharmac, ACC, HealthPathways, regional variations)
- ✓ Medtech partnership (NZ's largest PMS = real-world testing + 3,000+ GP access)
- ✓ Privacy-first (no training on production PHI; synthetic/de-identified only)

**R&D Uncertainty:** Can a small model (7B-13B parameters) achieve 70-80% of GPT-4/5 quality for NZ-specific clinical tasks under strict cost, privacy, and latency constraints?

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **PHI Leakage (Cross-Border)** | Low | Critical | No persistent PHI outside NZ; NZ-held keys; SIEM monitoring |
| **Unsafe Model Outputs** | Medium | Critical | Assist-only policy engine; monthly safety regressions (hard stop if >0.5%) |
| **Small Model Quality Insufficient** | Medium | High | Systematic experimentation; baseline GPT-4/5 comparison; iterative tuning |
| **Cashflow Shortfall** | Low | High | Income from GP clinical work funds co-contribution; cash always positive |
| **Over-Reliance by Clinicians** | Medium | High | Clear labeling; no auto-insert; training materials; periodic UI reminders |
| **Scope Creep / Misconfiguration** | Medium | Medium | Least-privilege Medtech scopes; change control gates |
| **Vendor/Sub-Processor Breach** | Low | Critical | Due diligence; DPA with breach notification; NZ-held key revocation |
| **Model Drift / Safety Degradation** | Medium | High | Version pinning; pre-release safety gates; monthly regressions |

## Why This Project Will Succeed

### Unique Founder Profile
- **Clinical Expertise:** Practicing GP who experiences the problem firsthand
- **Technical Expertise:** Full-stack developer with AI/ML expertise; built ClinicPro (operational product)
- **Market Access:** Medtech partnership = real-world testing + 3,000+ GP scale potential

### Commercial Validation
- ClinicPro is already operational (AI scribe using third-party LLM)
- Proven demand for AI assistance in NZ general practice
- This R&D makes it better, cheaper, safer, and expands capabilities

### De-Risking Strategy
1. **Synthetic-First Development** (Months 1-3) - No real patients
2. **Medtech Sandbox Testing** (Months 4-9) - Fake patient data only
3. **Monthly Safety Gates** - Hard stop if metrics fail
4. **Staged Pilot** (Month 10+) - Only after all gates passed

### Clear Constraints
- ✓ No diagnostic or treatment advice (assist-only)
- ✓ No training on production PHI (synthetic/de-identified only)
- ✓ No persistent PHI outside NZ (ephemeral AU inference only)
- ✓ No third-party commercial LLM APIs (self-hosted, NZ-controlled)
- ✓ No pilot until safety gates passed
