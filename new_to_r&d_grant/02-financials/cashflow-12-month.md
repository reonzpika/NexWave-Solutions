## Quarterly Eligible Totals and Grant Receipts

*For your "Grants" line*

| Quarter | Eligible Costs | Grant (40%) | Claim Submitted | Grant Received |
|---------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Q1** (M1?M3) | $22,568 | $9,027 | End of Month 3 | Month 4 |
| **Q2** (M4?M6) | $25,560 | $10,224 | End of Month 6 | Month 7 |

## Spreadsheet Structure (Recommended Tabs and Columns)

### Recommended Tabs

1. **Assumptions**
   - Rates, hours commitment, M&C, GP income, claim months, grant lag, GST rate

2. **Cashflow**
   - Columns: Month | Opening | GP Income | Grants | R&D Labour | CapDev Labour | M&C | Total Outflows | GST Net | Closing

3. **Hours Plan**
   - Per month split of R&D/CapDev hours
   - Auto-calculates labour costs at $96/h

4. **Claims**
   - Q1?Q4 eligible totals
   - 40% grant values
   - Expected payment months

5. **Notes**
   - Governance and reviewer notes

### Column Formulas (Examples)

**R&D labour cost (per month):**
```
= R&D_hours ? 96
```

**CapDev labour cost (per month):**
```
= CapDev_hours ? 96
```

**Total outflows (per month):**
```
= R&D_labour + CapDev_labour + M&C
```

**Closing cash:**
```
= Opening + GP_Income + Grants ? Total_outflows ? GST_net
```

**GST net (advice):** Model GST collected/paid on separate lines; keep above figures GST-exclusive.

## Governance and Reviewer Notes

*Include on a "Notes" tab*

- The company funds 60% co-funding and the working-capital float from GP clinical work income (~$11k/month)
- **Closing cash remains positive throughout** (ranging from $8,216 in Month 1 to $73,461 in Month 13)
- No production PHI is used for training; development uses synthetic/de-identified data only
- **Overseas labour is $0**; AU usage is transient inference only (no persistent PHI outside NZ)
- Quarterly claims are submitted at end of Months 3, 6, 9, 12
- Grants expected in Months 4, 7, 10, 13
- The stepped hours approach (16?20?24 hrs/week) allows sustainable scaling while maintaining quality and safety standards
