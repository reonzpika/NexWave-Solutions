# Proposal Status & Next Steps
## R&D Grant Submission - ClinicPro NZ GP Clinical LLM

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01  
**Status:** Mentor Review Ready; Gaps Identified for Final Submission

---

## ?? **Current Status: 6.9/10**

**Strong on:** Technical R&D justification, risk analysis, clear project planning  
**Weak on:** Commercialization strategy, market validation, demand evidence

---

## ? **STRENGTHS (Keep These)**

### **1. Project Planning (7/10)**
? **What's strong:**
- Detailed 12-month roadmap (Section 7) with Q1-Q4 breakdown
- 5 R&D Objectives (O1-O5) with specific dates, deliverables, and targets
- 3 Capability Development streams (CD-A/B/C)
- Clear milestones table with dates
- Detailed cost breakdown ($107,232) by objective, labour rates ($96/hr), M&C ($200/month)

?? **What's missing:**
- **No long-term vision beyond Year 1** (What happens in Year 2-5?)
- No discussion of scaling plan (100 GPs ? 3,000 GPs ? national/export)
- No IPO/acquisition/exit strategy

**Action needed:** Add "Long-Term Vision" subsection to Section 9

---

### **2. Risk Analysis (9/10)**
? **What's strong:**
- 8 risks identified with likelihood/impact/mitigation (Section 8)
- Covers technical (model quality, PHI leakage), financial (cashflow), operational (scope creep, vendor breach, model drift)
- Staged de-risking strategy (Section 9.4): synthetic-first ? sandbox ? safety gates ? pilot
- Monthly safety regressions with hard-stop criteria (prohibited-claim >0.5% = halt releases)

?? **What's missing:**
- Nothing major?this section is strong

---

### **3. Innovation Impact (7/10)**
? **What's strong:**
- Clear technical uncertainty (Section 3.3): "Can a small model (7B-13B params) achieve 70-80% of GPT-4/5 quality under NZ cost/privacy/latency constraints?"
- 4 strong, NZ-specific use cases (inbox, coding, referrals, care gaps)
- Quantified benefits: 30% time savings, 5% revenue uplift, 20-50x cheaper than Azure
- Competitive advantage: NZ-sovereign, multi-task (ONE model), cost-effective at scale

?? **What's missing:**
- **No long-term impact discussion** (contribution to NZ health tech ecosystem, export potential, IP value)
- Limited community/environmental impact (could add: reduced burnout ? better patient care ? healthier communities)

**Action needed:** Expand Section 10 with broader impact (community, environment, NZ tech ecosystem)

---

### **4. Clear & Specific (9/10)**
? **What's strong:**
- Plain language; LLM explained in Section 2.1
- Technical terms defined (assist-only, IPP 12, HIPC, HISO)
- Measurable success criteria (Section 10): 85% coding accuracy, 90% referral acceptance, 5s latency
- 4 use cases clearly described with "What it does" + "Why it's R&D" + "Success metrics"

?? **What's missing:**
- Nothing major?this section is strong

---

### **5. Credible Support (7/10)**
? **What's strong:**
- Data-driven cost estimates ($96/hr ? 1,062 hrs = $101,952; $200/month M&C)
- Realistic timeline (12 months for 4 use cases; stepped objectives)
- Cashflow forecast (Section 6.2) shows positive cash throughout ($5k ? $73k)
- Co-funding from GP clinical work income ($11k/month)

?? **What's missing:**
- **No evidence of co-funding capability** (no bank statement, no financial statements)
- No proof ClinicPro is operational (could add: screenshot, revenue figure, user count)

**Action needed:** Prepare bank statement, YTD P&L/Balance Sheet for actual submission (not for mentor)

---

## ?? **WEAKNESSES (Must Fix Before Submission)**

### **1. Market Analysis (4/10) - CRITICAL GAP**

? **MISSING:**
- **No evidence of demand:**
  - No customer testimonials from GPs
  - No letters of interest from clinics
  - No Medtech partnership letter/MOU/agreement
  - No market research data (surveys, interviews, focus groups)
  - We *claim* ClinicPro is operational but provide **no proof** (revenue, user count, growth)

- **Weak competitor analysis:**
  - Brief mention of Azure OpenAI cost comparison (Section 4)
  - Competitors (Nabla, Nuance DAX) mentioned but not analyzed
  - No competitive landscape map or SWOT
  - No "why us vs competitors" table

- **Target market not defined:**
  - We say "5,000 NZ GPs" but don't segment (rural vs urban? solo vs group practices? age demographics?)
  - No discussion of adoption barriers (tech-averse older GPs? practice manager buy-in?)
  - No total addressable market (TAM) / serviceable addressable market (SAM) calculation

**Action needed:**
1. **Get 2-3 letters of interest from GPs** (even informal emails work)
2. **Get Medtech partnership letter/MOU** or at least email confirmation of collaboration
3. **Create competitor analysis table** (Azure vs Nabla vs "do nothing" vs us)
4. **Define target market segments** (early adopters: tech-savvy, group practices, 30-50 age range?)
5. **Add to Section 2.2** or create new **Section 2.3: Market Validation**

---

### **2. Commercialization Strategy (5/10) - CRITICAL GAP**

? **MISSING:**
- **No pricing model:**
  - How will we charge? (Per-GP subscription? Per-transaction? Freemium?)
  - Example: $50/GP/month ? 3,000 GPs = $180k/year revenue
  
- **No revenue projections:**
  - Year 2-3 revenue forecast (pilot ? scale)
  - Break-even analysis (when does revenue cover R&D investment?)
  
- **No adoption timeline:**
  - Year 1 (R&D): Build and pilot (10-50 GPs)
  - Year 2: Early adopters (500 GPs)
  - Year 3-5: Scale to national (3,000+ GPs); explore export (Australia, Pacific Islands)
  
- **No go-to-market plan:**
  - How will we acquire customers post-R&D? (Medtech integration? Direct sales? Conferences?)
  - What's the pilot-to-paid conversion strategy?
  
- **No exit strategy:**
  - IPO? Acquisition by Medtech/health tech company? Bootstrap to profitability?

**Action needed:**
1. **Create new Section (after Section 10): "Commercialization & Market Strategy"**
   - Pricing model with revenue projections
   - 3-year adoption timeline (pilot ? scale ? export)
   - Go-to-market plan (Medtech rollout, conferences, direct sales)
   - Competitive positioning (why choose us over Azure/Nabla)

---

### **3. Why Grant Funding is Essential (7/10) - NOT EXPLICIT**

?? **What's weak:**
- We justify the R&D problem (cost, sovereignty, NZ-tuned)
- We show we can afford 60% co-funding
- **But we don't explicitly say:** "Without grant funding, this R&D is not viable because..."

? **What to add (1 paragraph in Section 1 or 6):**

> **Why Grant Funding is Essential:**
> 
> Grant funding is critical because commercial investors are risk-averse to early-stage R&D with uncertain technical outcomes. The cost/quality trade-off for small models under NZ constraints is unproven?no investor will fund systematic experimentation without guaranteed ROI. The 40% grant de-risks this R&D, enabling us to afford the 1,062 hours of systematic experimentation (O1-O5) required to resolve technical uncertainties. Without it, we would need to use expensive Azure OpenAI ($140k/month at scale), which is commercially unviable for NZ's 5,000 GP market. This grant makes a sovereign, cost-effective solution possible.

**Action needed:** Add 1 paragraph to **Section 6.2 (Cashflow Confidence)** or **Section 1 (Executive Summary)**

---

### **4. Community & Broader Impact (5/10) - WEAK**

?? **What's weak:**
- We focus on GP efficiency and cost savings (business impact)
- Limited discussion of patient outcomes, health equity, community benefits
- No environmental impact (e.g., paperless workflows? Reduced travel for remote consults?)
- No contribution to NZ AI/health tech ecosystem (IP, jobs, export earnings)

? **What to add:**

**Community Impact:**
- **Reduced GP burnout ? better patient care:** GPs spend 30.8% of time on admin; AI frees time for complex patients, improves consultation quality
- **Rural GP support:** AI reduces isolation/workload in under-resourced rural practices
- **Health equity:** Free up GP time for underserved populations (M?ori, Pacific, elderly)
- **Chronic disease management:** Proactive care gap monitoring improves PHO quality outcomes ? healthier population

**Economic Impact:**
- **NZ health tech ecosystem:** Contribute sovereign AI capability; reduce dependence on US tech
- **Export potential:** AU, Pacific Islands, UK (small markets with similar privacy concerns)
- **Job creation:** Year 2-3 hiring (data scientists, engineers, support staff)

**Action needed:** Add subsection to **Section 9.6 or Section 10**

## ?? **Questions to Ask Mentor**

When you send MENTOR-PROPOSAL.md, ask:

1. **Market Validation:**
   - "How much evidence of demand does Callaghan typically require? (Letters of interest? Surveys? Revenue proof?)"
   - "Is Medtech partnership letter essential, or can we describe the relationship verbally?"

2. **Commercialization:**
   - "Should we add a detailed commercialization section now, or save it for Stage 2 (if applicable)?"
   - "How detailed should revenue projections be for a pre-revenue R&D grant?"

3. **Grant Justification:**
   - "Is our '40% grant de-risks R&D' argument strong enough, or should we elaborate more on why commercial funding is unavailable?"

4. **Long-Term Vision:**
   - "Does Callaghan expect Year 2-5 roadmap in a New to R&D application, or is 12-month focus sufficient?"

5. **Overall:**
   - "What would Callaghan reviewers challenge most in this proposal?"
   - "On a scale of 1-10, how competitive is this for New to R&D funding?"
