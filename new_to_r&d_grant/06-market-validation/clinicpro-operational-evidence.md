# ClinicPro Operational Evidence
## Market Validation for R&D Grant Application

**Document Purpose:** Demonstrate that ClinicPro is operational and validates market demand for AI-assisted GP workflows, supporting the R&D grant application for expanded features.

**Prepared:** November 2025  
**Status:** Active - Early Stage  
**Prepared for:** Callaghan Innovation R&D Grant Application

---

## Executive Summary

ClinicPro is an operational AI scribe service currently being used by New Zealand general practitioners. While still in early stages with no paying customers yet, the active usage demonstrates **real-world demand** for AI-assisted GP workflows. This validates the market need identified in national surveys (RNZCGP, Pinnacle) and provides a foundation for expanding to the 4 additional use cases proposed in this R&D project.

**Key Points:**
- ✓ ClinicPro is live and operational
- ✓ Active GP users (early adopters)
- ✓ Real-world validation of AI-assisted GP workflows
- ✓ Foundation for expanding to inbox management, coding, referrals, and care gaps

## 6. Market Validation Summary

### 6.1 What ClinicPro Proves

1. **Real-World Demand:** GPs are actively using AI-assisted workflows, validating the market need identified in national surveys

2. **Technical Feasibility:** AI can generate clinically relevant notes that integrate with NZ practice management systems

3. **User Acceptance:** GPs are willing to adopt AI tools when they solve real problems (documentation burden)

4. **Integration Capability:** Successful integration with Medtech demonstrates ability to work within NZ healthcare IT infrastructure

5. **Foundation for Expansion:** Current scribe functionality provides foundation for expanding to inbox management, coding, referrals, and care gaps

### 6.2 Connection to R&D Project

**Current State (ClinicPro):**
- ✓ AI scribe operational
- ✓ Medtech integration proven
- ✓ GP adoption demonstrated
- ✗ Uses third-party LLM (privacy/cost concerns)
- ✗ Limited to scribing only

**R&D Project Will Address:**
- ✓ Replace third-party LLM with NZ-sovereign self-hosted model
- ✓ Add 4 new use cases (inbox, coding, referrals, care gaps)
- ✓ Reduce costs by 20-50x (self-hosted vs commercial APIs)
- ✓ Ensure NZ data sovereignty (no offshore data transmission)

**Why This Matters:**
ClinicPro's operational status proves:
- The market exists (GPs want AI assistance)
- The integration works (Medtech compatibility)
- The workflow is acceptable (GPs adopt and use it)
- The R&D project is building on proven demand, not speculation

## 7. Limitations & Future Plans

### 7.1 Current Limitations

- **No paying customers yet:** Still in early validation phase
- **Limited to scribing:** Only one use case currently
- **Third-party LLM dependency:** Privacy and cost concerns at scale
- **Small user base:** Early adopters only

### 7.2 Why R&D Funding is Needed

These limitations are exactly why R&D funding is essential:

1. **Privacy & Sovereignty:** Need NZ-sovereign model (no offshore data)
2. **Cost at Scale:** Current third-party LLM costs ($140k+/month) are unsustainable
3. **Expanded Functionality:** Need R&D to add inbox, coding, referrals, care gaps
4. **NZ-Specific Tuning:** Need model trained on NZ clinical codes, HealthPathways, regional variations

**Without R&D funding:** ClinicPro remains limited to scribing with privacy/cost concerns, unable to address the 4 critical workflows identified in national surveys.

**With R&D funding:** ClinicPro expands to comprehensive GP workflow assistant, addressing root causes of burnout (inbox overload, coding complexity, referral quality, care gap monitoring).
